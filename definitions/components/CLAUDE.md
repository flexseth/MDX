# Objective

Create functional MDX example files for consumption as skills and supporting documentation for WordPress projects created with Claude.

The various components are found in the Gutenberg portion of WordPress's monorepo on GitHub. 
https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/trunk/packages/components/src

Each component should have examples. I'd like you to create a consumable MDX interface for viewing the components, including rich previews if possible. 

Ask questions if you are unsure. Please organize the components. 

Start with a random component so I can review it.
